    # get log ==> logging.getLogger()  # Retrieve a logger object
    # logfile ==> log file path  # Path where the log file is stored
    # logformat ==> logs format  # Format of the log messages
    # setformatter ==> link file and format  # Associate the format with the file handler
    # add handler --> maintain all logs every time in log file  # Ensure logs are written to the file

    # error  # Errors that occur during program execution
